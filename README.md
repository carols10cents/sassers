# Sassers

A Sass compiler written natively in Rust.

**Incomplete!!!!** To see current progress:

* Clone this project and `cargo build`
* Clone [sass-spec](https://github.com/sass/sass-spec/) and get ruby and all that good stuff
* In sass-spec, run `./sass-spec.rb -c '/path/to/your/sassers/executable'

Last run I did was 266 passing and 4233 failing out of 4499 tests. So yeah, REALLY NOT DONE YET.

Progress bar: [=-------------------]
